This directory contains the data accompanying the [post](https://zhauniarovich.com/post/2020/2020-02-configuring-python-workspace/) on configuring Python workspace. In particular, there are two files with bash code:
1. `py_env_config.sh` This is a bash script to configure Python workspace. In particular, it installs pyenv, creates several global virtual environments, and configure them.
2. `pip_functions.sh` This file contains two functions that facilitate the process of managing package dependencies.
